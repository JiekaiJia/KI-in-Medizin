### Basic concepts
- **Precision**  
  Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted 
  positive observations.
- **Recall**  
  Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations 
  in actual class
- **Accuracy**  
  It is simply a ratio of correctly predicted observation to the total observations.  
- **F1 score**  
  F1 Score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall.
