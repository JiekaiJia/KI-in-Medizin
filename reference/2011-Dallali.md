# FUZZY C-MEANS CLUSTERING, NEURAL NETWORK, WT, AND HRV FOR CLASSIFICATION OF CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA

### Introduction
All the samples must be normalized in order to have the features at the same level. ECG signals can be
contaminated with several kinds of noise, such as **powerline interference (A/C)**, **baseline wandering (BW)**, and
**electromyography noise (EMG)**, which can affect the extraction of parameters used for classification, so we
want to filter the signal. **ECG was filtered using Low pass filter and high pass filter**. The pre-treatment of ECG signals
imposes the suppression of each perturbation signals, the noise high frequency electromyography and the low
frequency drift. After that, the signal baseline may be shifted from zero line. **The baseline of the ECG signal was
adjusted at zero line by subtracting the median of the ECG signal**.
